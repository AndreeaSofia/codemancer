## ✨ What is Codemancer?

**Codemancer** is a simple, modular Python script that checks if the core tools of a programming environment are installed (Python, pip, Git, and VS Code CLI) and gently helps you install them if not.

These are the tools I started my own journey with.

I just wanted to make something small that might’ve helped _me_ when I was first getting started.
But Codemancer can grow however you like - feel free to personalize it, expand it, or pass it on to someone else at the start of theirs.

## 💻 How to run

1. Open a terminal (like Git Bash or Command Prompt).

2. Navigate to the folder where you want to place the project:

```
cd your/desired/path
```

3. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/AndreeaSofia/codemancer.git
```

4. Move into the project folder:
   
```
cd codemancer
```

5. Run the wizard:

```
python wizard.py
```

That’s it! Codemancer will check for Python, pip, Git, and the VS Code CLI. If something’s missing, it’ll help you find and install it - no stress, no scary errors.
